# Japanese Learning Log App

This is to keep tracking my Japanese language learning in a fun way while discovering vibe-coding mechanisms.

## How to run

First, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Navigate to the app directory:

```bash
cd japanese-log
```

Then run the main script:

```bash
uv run streamlit run app.py
```
